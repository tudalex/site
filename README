Requirements:
	apt-get install fabric ruby1.9.1-dev
	apt-get install rubygems1.8
	gem install jekyll

Testing:
	fab devel #then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser
Deploy:
	fab deploy


Troubleshooting:
	If using Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint and jekyll command is not found
	double check where the gem bins are and make sure that path is in your PATH
	environment variable.
	
	In most cases they should be under /usr/lib/ruby/gems, but
	/var/lib/gems/{1.8|1.9.1}/bin is used instead.

	If page looks stripped down, then you're probably into the wrong branch.
	Do not work in gh-pages, nor merge it back in master. Always rebase
	from master and push gh-pages only for previewing at: http://rosedu.github.com/site/
